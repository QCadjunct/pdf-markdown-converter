## üì¢ Introduction

[üîº Back to TOC](#top)

Astral Uv is a modern Python package manager and installer built with Rust, offering significant performance improvements over existing tools like Poetry and pip. This guide provides a detailed, step-by-step process for migrating your Python project from Poetry to Uv while preserving all your dependencies, scripts, and configurations.

Uv brings several advantages:

- ‚ö° Significantly faster package installation and dependency resolution
- üîç Enhanced compatibility with PEP standards
- üîí Improved security and reliability
- üß© Simpler dependency management

<a id="prerequisites"></a>

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

[üîº Back to TOC](#top)

Before starting the migration process, ensure you have:

- An existing Poetry project with `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` files
- Python 3.7+ installed
- Administrative permissions to install new tools
- A backup of your project (preferably in a version control system)

## üöÄ Migration Steps

[üîº Back to TOC](#top)

<a id="step-1"></a>

### Step 1: Install Uv

[üîº Back to TOC](#top)

First, install Uv. There are several methods available:

#### Using pip (recommended for most users):

```bash
pip install uv
```

#### Using Homebrew (macOS):

```bash
brew install astral/tap/uv
```

#### Using the installer script (Unix-like systems):

```bash
curl -sSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Verify the installation was successful:

```bash
uv --version
```

You should see output similar to: `uv 0.6.13 (a0f5c7250 2025-04-07)`

<a id="step-2"></a>

### Step 2: Create a Backup

[üîº Back to TOC](#top)

Always create backups before beginning a migration:

```bash
# Backup your pyproject.toml
cp pyproject.toml pyproject.toml.backup

# Backup your poetry.lock if it exists
if [ -f poetry.lock ]; then
    cp poetry.lock poetry.lock.backup
fi
```

<a id="step-3"></a>

### Step 3: Export Dependencies

[üîº Back to TOC](#top)

If you have Poetry installed and working, export your dependencies to a requirements file:

```bash
poetry export --without-hashes -f requirements.txt > requirements.txt

# If you have dev dependencies
poetry export --without-hashes --with dev -f requirements.txt > requirements-dev.txt
```

If Poetry is not available, you'll need to manually extract dependencies from your `pyproject.toml` file in the next step.

<a id="step-4"></a>

### Step 4: Convert pyproject.toml

[üîº Back to TOC](#top)

Create a new Uv-compatible `pyproject.toml` file. Here's a template that you can adapt to your project:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[project]
name = "your-package-name"  # Replace with your package name
version = "0.1.0"  # Replace with your version
description = "Your package description"
authors = [
    {name = "Your Name", email = "your.email@example.com"},
]
readme = "README.md"
license = {text = "MIT"}  # Replace with your license
requires-python = ">=3.7"  # Adjust as needed for your project
dependencies = [
    # List your dependencies here, for example:
    # "requests>=2.25.1",
    # "numpy>=1.20.0",
]

[project.optional-dependencies]
# Define optional dependency groups, equivalent to Poetry's extras
dev = [
    # Development dependencies
]

[project.scripts]
# Define console scripts here
# my-script = "my_package.module:function"

[tool.uv]
link-mode = "copy"

[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
packages = ["src/your_package"]  # Adjust to match your package structure

[tool.hatch.build.targets.sdist]
include = [
    # Include additional files in the source distribution
]

[tool.hatch.metadata]
allow-direct-references = true
```

Key differences between Poetry and Uv/PEP 621 format:

| Poetry Format | Uv/PEP 621 Format |
|---------------|-------------------|
| `[tool.poetry]` | `[project]` |
| `[tool.poetry.dependencies]` | `dependencies = []` under `[project]` |
| `[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]` | `[project.optional-dependencies]` |
| `[tool.poetry.scripts]` | `[project.scripts]` |

For a real-world example, here's a more complete conversion from Poetry to Uv format:

#### Original Poetry Format:

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "example-app"
version = "1.2.3"
description = "An example application"
authors = ["Your Name <your.email@example.com>"]
readme = "README.md"
license = "MIT"

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.8"
requests = "^2.28.1"
pandas = "^1.5.0"

[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]
pytest = "^7.0.0"
black = "^22.10.0"

[tool.poetry.scripts]
example-cli = "example_app.cli:main"

[build-system]
requires = ["poetry-core>=1.0.0"]
build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"
```

#### Converted Uv/PEP 621 Format:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[project]
name = "example-app"
version = "1.2.3"
description = "An example application"
authors = [
    {name = "Your Name", email = "your.email@example.com"}
]
readme = "README.md"
license = {text = "MIT"}
requires-python = ">=3.8"
dependencies = [
    "requests>=2.28.1",
    "pandas>=1.5.0",
]

[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [
    "pytest>=7.0.0",
    "black>=22.10.0",
]

[project.scripts]
example-cli = "example_app.cli:main"

[tool.uv]
link-mode = "copy"

[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
packages = ["example_app"]
```

Note the following key changes:
- Dependencies moved from `[tool.poetry.dependencies]` to arrays under `[project].dependencies`
- Version constraints use `>=` instead of `^`
- Author format changes from strings to objects with name and email fields
- Dev dependencies moved to `[project.optional-dependencies].dev`

### Step 5: Create a Virtual Environment

[üîº Back to TOC](#top)

Create a new virtual environment using Uv:

```bash
uv venv --python 3.10  # Replace with your target Python version
```

This will create a `.venv` directory in your project. Activate it:

#### On Windows:

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### On macOS/Linux:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

<a id="step-6"></a>

### Step 6: Install Dependencies

[üîº Back to TOC](#top)

Install your project dependencies using one of these methods:

#### From the updated pyproject.toml:

```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

#### From the exported requirements file:

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### For development dependencies:

```bash
# If using pyproject.toml with optional dependencies
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Or if using a separate requirements file
uv pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

After installing dependencies, you can use `uv sync` to ensure all dependencies are synced to your environment:

```bash
uv sync
```

<a id="step-7"></a>

### Step 7: Test Your Application

[üîº Back to TOC](#top)

Verify that your application works correctly with the new package manager:

1. Run your test suite:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

2. Run your application locally:
   ```bash
   python -m your_package
   ```

3. Check that all entry points and scripts work correctly.

If you encounter issues, see the [Common Issues](#common-issues) section.

<a id="step-8"></a>

### Step 8: Update CI/CD Pipelines

[üîº Back to TOC](#top)

Update your CI/CD configuration files to use Uv instead of Poetry. Here are examples for common CI systems:

#### GitHub Actions:

```yaml
name: Python tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v5
      with:
        python-version: '3.10'
    - name: Install uv
      run: pip install uv
    - name: Create virtual environment
      run: uv venv
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
    - name: Run tests
      run: pytest
```

#### GitLab CI:

```yaml
test:
  image: python:3.10
  before_script:
    - pip install uv
    - uv venv
    - source .venv/bin/activate
    - uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
  script:
    - pytest
```

#### CircleCI:

```yaml
version: 2.1
jobs:
  build-and-test:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/python:3.10
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Install uv
          command: pip install uv
      - run:
          name: Create virtual environment
          command: uv venv
      - run:
          name: Install dependencies
          command: |
            source .venv/bin/activate
            uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
      - run:
          name: Run tests
          command: |
            source .venv/bin/activate
            pytest
```

<a id="step-9"></a>

### Step 9: Remove Poetry Files

[üîº Back to TOC](#top)

Once you're confident the migration is successful, you can remove Poetry-specific files:

```bash
# Remove poetry.lock
rm poetry.lock

# Optional: Remove Poetry from your development environment
pip uninstall poetry -y
```

Update your documentation and contributor guidelines to reflect the use of Uv instead of Poetry.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues and Solutions

[üîº Back to TOC](#top)

### Hardlink Warnings

**Problem:** You see warnings about hardlinks failing:
```
warning: Failed to hardlink files; falling back to full copy. This may lead to degraded performance.
```

**Solution:** Add the `link-mode = "copy"` setting in the `[tool.uv]` section of your pyproject.toml, or set the environment variable:
```bash
export UV_LINK_MODE=copy
```

### Dependency Resolution Errors

**Problem:** Uv cannot resolve dependencies that worked with Poetry.

**Solution:**
1. Try loosening version constraints (use `>=` instead of strict versions)
2. Check for direct GitHub/URL dependencies, which may need special handling
3. Install problem dependencies individually:
   ```bash
   uv pip install problematic-package==specific-version
   ```

### Missing Scripts or Entry Points

**Problem:** Command-line scripts defined in Poetry aren't available after migration.

**Solution:** Ensure you've correctly defined scripts in the `[project.scripts]` section and reinstall your package with:
```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

### Package Build Issues

**Problem:** Your package doesn't build correctly with the new build backend.

**Solution:**
1. Check the `[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]` section to ensure it points to the correct package directory
2. Verify any include/exclude patterns in the build configuration
3. Try building manually to see detailed errors:
   ```bash
   uv pip install build
   python -m build
   ```
